# Readme to get setup
## this is makeshift for now

### For web_scrapper.py 
- libraries
    - Selenium --> opens a web browser and runs tasks in it using a script.  need web browser drivers installed 
    - ChromeDriver downloads
    - BS4 --> built in python HTML parser.  scrapes using tags and attributes 
        - Scrapy is another option here


**NOTE:** I am using an environment for all of my dependencies called "codagent_tools"
