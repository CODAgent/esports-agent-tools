# CODAgent stat manager 

## Specific stats to aggregate 

- Player combined stats 
- Player gamemode stats
- Player map stats
- Player map and gamemode stats

### For each player within those flavors 

- Average kills per map 
- Average deaths per map
- Average damage per map 
- Average obj stats per map 
- Total KD ratio per map 
    - Sum up kills and deaths.  Kills divided by deaths 

## Ideas for later 

- Easy way to collect stats 
    - Collect image screen shots of scoreboards and use OCR (optical character recognition) to extract the items from the scoreboard and upload stats 
    - Scrape the breaking point website
